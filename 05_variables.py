# learning variables

'''Rules for defining a variable name:-
1.  Always starts with a alphabet or underscore.
2.  Never starts with a digit or '@' symbol.
3.  Can contain alphabets, digits or underscore.
4.  No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
5.  Variables can't be named after keywords of python, like: def, True, False, import, elif, else, while, in, class, for, or, if.
    Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.
    False               class               from                or
    None                continue            global              pass
    True                def                 if                  raise
    and                 del                 import              return
    as                  elif                in                  try
    assert              else                is                  while
    async               except              lambda              with
    await               finally             nonlocal            yield
    break               for 
6. Some examples of valid variables are:
    Mayank, abc_, _abc, abc84, a
7. Some examples of invalid variables are:
    1abc, @abc, 13, a  bc, Mayank@8, None, True
8.  Variables are case sensitive. '''
